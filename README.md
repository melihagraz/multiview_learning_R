## Run feature selection
How to obtain the hardcoded features in self.R and base.R.

## Run examples
I am expecting six files, 
- *baseline.R* containing the function to run baseline models, *main_baseline.R* containing the main function which calls the function in *baseline.R* 
and output the results;
- *cotraining.R* and *main_cotraining.R* similar to above; 
- *multi-view_cotraining.R* and *main_multi-view_cotraining.R* similar to above.

Please make the file names speak for themselves.
