## Description

This project provides a template structure of folders and files for Multi-view Learning ACCORD Project. You are going to see 3 different code structures like ```base_ML_.R```, ```self_ML_.R``` and ```CO_ML_.R```. 

```base_ML_.main.R```, ```self_ML_.main.R``` and ```CO_ML_.main.R``` are the main part of the conventional, self training and co-training of code,respectively and you have to run the ```base_ML_.run.R```, ```self_ML_.run.R``` and ```CO_ML_.run.R``` to run the main codes. You can see detailed explanation of these three ```main``` and ```run``` code. 

### Conventional Machine Learning (base_.R)

```base_ML.main.R``` is the main code of the conventional machine learning. You can run Logisctic Regression, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest conventional Machine Learning models. If your data is imbalanced, you can balance your data with ```imbalanced=TRUE```. You can choose the number of folds by ```n_fold```, default is 5.  We have already done the feature selection algorithm for ACCORD dataset and specified the selected features. For this reason, you can select these specified futures by typing ```feature_sel =  "Boruta"``` or ```feature_sel =  "Boruta"``` or ```feature_sel =  "Boruta"``` OR if you want to work on only the full ACCORD data, you can type ```feature_sel =  "NO FS"```.

Column name of your response variable must be  ```out```.

### Example

If you want to run Logistic Regression, working on imbalanced data on train, without feature selection, with 5 fold cross validation. 

```{r setup1, include=FALSE}
Baseline_Hyp(dataL = dataL, 
                 method           = "Logistic Regression" ,
                 imbalanced       =  TRUE,
                 feature_sel      =  "NO FS",
                 n_fold           =  5 
)
```

If you want to run SVM, working on NOT imbalanced data, with LASSO feature selection, with 5 fold cross validation. 

```{r setup1, include=FALSE}
Baseline_Hyp(dataL = dataL, 
                 method           = "SVM" ,
                 imbalanced       =  FALSE,
                 feature_sel      =  "Lasso",
                 n_fold           =  5 
)
```

If you want to run the  ```main``` code, you could need```base_ML.run.R``` (it is not necessary).  


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Template Project

This project provides a template structure of folders and files for an R project.

## Folder Structure

The project comprises of three main folders in which you would store certain files.

### data/

This folder should contain data files like .csv, .xls, .spss, etc.

In this folder:

- An example data set of bird information taken from the [UCLA statistics teaching material](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/projects/datasets/).

### R/

This folder should contain R script files.

In this folder:

- Template script with the key section headers described by the [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml).

### Rmd/

This folder should contain all R markdown and associated files.

In this folder:

- **reference_docx/** which should contain any reference documents to be used by R Markdown file. This currently includes:
  - A default APA-style word doc, "APA-style-01.docx"
- **bib/** which should contain bibliographies to be used by R Markdown file. This currently includes:
  - An example bibliography file, "example-bib.bib"
- **img/** which should contain images to be inserted into R Markdown file. This currently imcludes:
  - An image showing the output formats generated by R Markdown, "RMarkdownOutputFormats.png"
- A template R Markdown for producing APA-style word documents. For styling, this references "reference_docx/APA-style-01.docx"
